## StreamAll-servers
StreamAll is a private streaming site to allow connections to view and access personal videos online

## Motivation
This site was created to further practice full-stack development techniques, as well as work through the technicalities of streaming technology. In addition, this was created to help solve access issues to personal videos when I'm away from the content host

## Code Breakdown
This repo serves as the backend for the site, allowing for video catalogging, searching, and uploading. Code was written in Go, with databasing done in MongoDB (subject to change)

## Credits
Special thanks to Dr. Stearns for teaching me the bulk of the techniques applied here and for his fabulous collection of online tutorials: https://drstearns.github.io/tutorials/
